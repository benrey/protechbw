                    <p class="para text-center pt5 pb-3">What is Powder Coating?<br>
                        Powder coating is an electrostatic process of applying powder pigment and resin to a metal
                        surface. The powder coated pieces are then placed in ovens to “cure”, resulting in a smooth and
                        resilient coating that is bonded to the metal substrate.
                        How is Powder Coating different than Wet Coating Systems?<br>
                        Unlike wet coating applications, powder coating does not require a solvent to keep the binder
                        and filler parts in a liquid suspension form. As such, there are no drying times needed. Due to
                        the absence of these solvents, powder coating is environmentally friendlier than wet coatings
                        systems.
                        Is Powder Coating better than Wet Painting?<br>
                        The powder coating process results in a more durable, more chip-resistant, and better-looking
                        finish than its wet coating in most cases. Depending on application or certification
                        requirements, wet paint could be the proper course of action. Coating Specialists can help you
                        determine the proper coating for the application.
                        The durability of powder coating is mainly attributed to its fusion-bonded properties. The
                        resulting bond handles, bumps, abrasions, and impacts significantly better than most wet coating
                        applications.
                        The finish is also more resilient to UV degradation, corrosion, and chemical erosion in most
                        cases. This weather ability allows powder coating to withstand extreme conditions much better
                        than paint, thereby extending the substrate’s protected life.
                        Powder is cured in an oven and has an even-finish across all surfaces with no signs of drips,
                        runs, sags, or any other application traces. It is available in a wide variety of glosses,
                        textures, and colors.
                        What items can be Powder Coated?<br>
                        Iron, wrought iron, aluminum, titanium, stainless steel, metal castings, magnesium and steel.
                        Warping is a concern on very thin pieces. Seals, bushings, or accessory pieces made of plastic
                        or rubber need to be removed prior to the powder coating process.
                        How do you prepare parts for Powder Coating?<br>
                        Abrasive blasting items to remove oils, dirt, and other coatings. Coating Specialists uses all
                        virgin aluminum oxide 60grit and 100 grit in an enclosed reclaim booth. Certain circumstances,
                        require a prebake to remove oils that might be imbedded into the metal and other times to
                        chemically strip some previous coated parts. Coating Specialists will determine if this is
                        needed prior to abrasive blasting.
                        Not only does this abrasive blasting technique remove grease, rust, and dirt contaminate, it
                        also creates a solid “anchor-profile” from which the powder adheres to when curing. On some
                        industrial parts, an anchor profile of called out on the print. Coating Specialists has the
                        ability to measure the profile prior to coating. This is part of the reason why powder coating
                        has such a resilient and tough shell.
                        What is the benefit of media blasting / abrasive blasting?<br>
                        The removal of all surface contaminants (rust, paint, grease) is one of the most crucial
                        elements to providing a coating that will protect the substrate and prevent corrosion. If the
                        surface area is not free of all contaminants and does not have a proper anchor profile for
                        coatings to adhere to, then the surface is only as strong as the material that you are coating
                        over. This prep applies for powder coating, industrial coating, hydro graphics, and Cerakote.
                        Can you powder coat pieces that have already been painted/powder coated?<br>
                        In certain circumstances, the original coating does not need to be fully removed as the anchor
                        profile is strong. Coating Specialists will determine if this is needed prior to abrasive
                        blasting.
                        What about nut and bolt threads, or areas that need to be kept free of coating?<br>
                        To keep powder away from threaded components or low-tolerance areas, high-temperature masking
                        tape and silicon plugs are used. Any project requirements or masking concerns will be addressed
                        and signed off on prior to beginning the process.
                        What colors and textures are available?<br>
                        With stock colors to choose from, Coating Specialists keeps a large inventory made for reduced
                        price points and shorter lead times. We also offer a wide variety of colors, glosses, textures,
                        candies and metallic. Each sample can be seen in our showroom or an employee can help find a
                        color from our suppliers. We can special order colors, but cost and lead time will vary.
                        Does Houston Powder Coaters offer High Temperature Resistant Coatings?<br>
                        Coating Specialists offers high temperature silicone powder coating to protect surfaces with
                        prolonged exposure to temps up to 1200°. This coating is resistant to delamination and cracking
                        when exposed to these high temperatures. Applications for this type coating include outdoor BBQ
                        grills and furnaces, agricultural and construction equipment (ACE), and certain auto parts.
                        We recommend using Cerakote C-Series for all exhaust and manifold systems. Of course it can be
                        used for BBQ grills or any high temp application large or small. This ceramic coating can
                        withstand temperatures up to 1800 degrees without color loss or delamination.

                        What imperfections will Powder Coating cover up?<br>
                        Powder coating can cover up minor scratches and small imperfections. However, as with most
                        coatings, the end-result is only as good as the surface it is applied to. Weld splatter, grind
                        marks, tack welds, and poor craftsmanship will still show through.
                        Do you handle small jobs?<br>
                        Big and small projects as well as large and small quantities. We work on fishing jigs all the
                        way up to horse trailers.
                        What are your turnaround times?<br>
                        Typically, Coating Specialists can turn industrial items in 1-2 weeks depending upon arrival
                        time, stock versus special order colors, and masking requirements. Faster turnarounds are
                        available with expedite charge. Coating Specialists will be clear and upfront on turnaround
                        times at the beginning of each job and inform the customer of any delays.
                        Are COCs (Certificates of Compliance / Certificates of Conformance) available?<br>
                        Yes, Coating Specialists will provide COCs assuring millage requirements, blasting requirements,
                        holiday testing, and/or other noted specifications. These will be drawn up and agreed to before
                        the start of any project.
                        Hydrographics, water transfer printing, water transfer imaging, hydro dipping is a method of
                        applying printed designs to three-dimensional surfaces.
                        The hydrographic printing process is extensively used to decorate items that range from entire
                        all-terrain vehicles and car dashboards, to small items like bike helmets, cups, cell phone
                        cases, and motorcycle frames. Films can be applied to all types of substrates including plastic,
                        fiberglass, wood, ceramics, and metal.
                        In the process, the substrate piece to be printed first goes through the entire painting
                        process: surface preparation, priming, painting, and clear coating. The process requires good
                        preparation and is firstly coated with a primer. After the primer dries, base coat paint is
                        applied to match with the pattern. So, for example, woodgrain prints often utilize a brown base
                        coat and many camouflage patterns use specific base color. After the base color is applied, the
                        item is ready for the water transfer printing process.

                        After painting but before clear coating, the part is ready to be dipped. This process utilizes a
                        water-soluble film that contains the printed designs. It is carefully placed on the water's
                        surface in the dipping tank. The clear film is water soluble, and dissolves after applying an
                        activator solution. Once dipping has begun, the surface tension of the water will allow the
                        pattern to curve around any shape. Any remaining residue is then rinsed off thoroughly. The ink
                        has already adhered and will not wash off. It is then allowed to dry before a protective clear
                        coat is applied.
                        Advantages
                        Hydrographics advantages are the level of customization. You can choose different basecoats,
                        prints and clear coats all to create something truly unique.

                        Application
                        Hydrographic patterns include carbon fiber, woodgrain, camouflage, geometrical patterns, and a
                        wide variety of other prints are available for application.

                        The Hydrographics process is used worldwide to decorate materials including plastic, wood,
                        fiberglass, metal, and ceramics.Uses for Hydrographics are:
